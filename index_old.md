### Funding a Degree at Harvard
Funding a master's degree can be difficult. As a helpful (but ultimately incomplete) resource, we've compiled some helpful funding and mentoring opportunities [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K2rh_ujtOuJ2d6Qcox6xIoUWAQWZDOAzFyqqLKI7zUo/edit?usp=sharing).
The list primarily consists of **opportunities for those who have been historically underrepresented in data science and computational science**. 
We hope these can help you find a way to join us at Harvard!
