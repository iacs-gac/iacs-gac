# How to deploy changes

Changes are propagated via the `gh-pages` branch - make sure you're on the `gh-pages` branch before committed any changes or edits via GitHub. 
Once your changes have been pushed, you'll see a yellow dot next to the commit hash, like so:

There will be a total of three checks to pass for each new commit (it usually takes about 1 minute). When all three checks turn green, check out your live changes
on the public site (iacs-gac.github.io)! Make sure it looks good and correct anything that's unintended.
