        <p>Hello! The Graduate Advisory Committee on Diversity, Inclusion, and Leadership in Applied Computation (GAC) is a Departmental Graduate Student Organization representing students and alumni of Harvard’s graduate programs in Data Science and Applied Computation.</p>

        <p>Established in Summer 2020 as a collaborative effort between students, faculty, and administrators at Harvard’s <a href = "https://iacs.seas.harvard.edu/">Institute for Applied Computational Science (IACS)</a>, GAC and its student leaders have a mandate to:<p>
        <ul>
            <li>work with IACS staff to foster an inclusive and welcoming environment</li>
            <li>design guidelines for the IACS diversity, inclusion, and belonging strategy</li>
            <li>amplify the voices of underrepresented groups in Applied Computation</li>
            <li>provide a forum for students to gain diversity and inclusion leadership experience within the academic domain</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Membership in GAC is open to all IACS affiliates, and many of GAC’s current members hold membership in one or more historically minoritized groups in STEM.</p>

        <p>GAC’s student leadership includes two co-chairs, as well as subcommittee chairs representing our six areas of engagement:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Admissions, Recruiting, & Funding</li>
            <li>Career Development & Mentorship</li>
            <li>Community Building</li>
            <li>Historically Minoritized Student Support</li>
            <li>International Student Support</li>
            <li>Pedagogy</li>
        </ul>
